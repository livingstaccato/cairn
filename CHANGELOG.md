# Changelog

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and
versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) once tagged. See the
`--version` flag for the version currently embedded in `main`.

## main

### Added

- A `--version` flag on the root command. `go run`/`go build` report `dev`;
  `make build` (`ci/build.sh`) injects the tag `git describe` resolves via
  `-ldflags`, so the reported version tracks the tag rather than a source
  literal someone has to remember to bump.
